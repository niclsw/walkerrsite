Welcome to the new site. This post is written in **MDX**, which means I can mix markdown and React components when needed.

## Why This?

As with most mid-size companies, customers often inundate our lines with questions that they could find themselves by using our apps. This trends up as the company grows and the apps become larger.

Now, this begs the question: "How likely would someone want to communicate with AI?"

Yes, I asked myself this too. However, AI is a big buzz word in executive circles so we're kind of in a no-win situation here. Either way, this is a great opportunity to learn something which is what I love to do. 

## Now What?

Books... lots of books. I don't know why I like to buy technical books. Maybe because it looks cool when I have something titled "DAX IN MODERN ENVIORNMENTS" on my desk for all to see who step inside my small cramped apartment. Maybe they think, "this guy thinks". In reality, I read maybe 10 pages front to back then browse through topics and think, "what a waste of money..". 

But, this will be different. I will read these books in completion since now I have a website to give my thoughts too! 

```ts
export function greet(name: string) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}
```

Thatâ€™s it for now. More soon.
