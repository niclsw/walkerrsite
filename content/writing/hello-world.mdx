Welcome to the new site. This post is written in **MDX**, which means I can mix markdown and React components when needed.

## Why MDX

- Simple, versioned content in Git
- Great performance via static generation
- Full control over layout and components

```ts
export function greet(name: string) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}
```

Thatâ€™s it for now. More soon.
